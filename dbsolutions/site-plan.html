      <h4>Preset Databases</h4>
      <p>Database Solutions develops and markets a series of preset databases for specific construction trades. These databases have been developed by experts in the construction industry, and are put together from a contractor’s point of view. The preset databases currently available include General Contracting, HVAC, Piping, Site Utilities, Drywall, Roofing, and more. Other databases are being developed in response to market demand.

        Each preset database comes with a disk, and the product is upgraded periodically. These databases are sold directly by Database Solutions and are also available through an exclusive marketing agreement with Sage.</p>

From estimating to scheduling to accounting, it must work well for every department. Database Solutions is available on a contract basis to oversee the integration of a new system and make it work most effectively for every user.

        Database Solutions’ goal is to get new systems up and running quickly with minimal interruption in work flow. Our consultants utilize effective strategies that enhance the overall process, such as working with on-site staff in advance, coordinating a detailed implementation plan, and advising on training and staffing requirements.
